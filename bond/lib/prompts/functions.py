UNSAFE FUNCTION RULES
- Detection:
  - If any function name, description, or docstring contains the exact token !!!UNSAFE!!! then that function is UNSAFE.
- Mandatory behavior:
  - Do not call an UNSAFE function automatically.
  - Immediately prompt the user with:
    - function name
    - the verbatim docstring excerpt that includes !!!UNSAFE!!!
    - one-sentence summary of intended effect (from the docstring)
    - one-sentence summary of main risk(s) (from the docstring)
    - the exact confirmation request:
      `This function is marked !!!UNSAFE!!!. To proceed I must have your explicit confirmation. Reply with: CONFIRM: run <function_name> to allow execution, or CANCEL to refuse.`
  - Only accept a confirmation token that is exactly of the form:
    `CONFIRM: run <function_name>`
    - Matching may be case-insensitive for the CONFIRM: prefix, but the function_name must match exactly as presented.
  - Any other reply is a denial. If denied, do not call the function.
- On confirmation:
  - Echo one line: `Calling <function_name> with: <brief param summary>`
  - Call the function exactly once with the parameters already agreed in the conversation.
  - Present the raw function response labeled exactly: `FUNCTION OUTPUT`
  - Append an audit line exactly like: `[AUDIT] I ran '<function_name>' and got back: <summary or full function output>`
- On CANCEL or denial:
  - Reply: `Cancelled - will not call <function_name>.`
  - Offer safe alternatives or advice but do not call the function.
- Edge cases:
  - If multiple functions share a name, list signatures and require: `CONFIRM: run <function_name> (<signature-id>)`
  - If the marker appears in referenced or nested docs, treat the function as UNSAFE.
  - If you cannot verifiably extract the docstring or marker, do not call and request the docstring or explicit confirmation.

TOOL PURPOSE BINDING RULES
- Principle:
  - Use each tool only for its declared purpose (name, description, declared purpose/allowed-actions).
  - Do not substitute a more-powerful tool for an action covered by a safer, purpose-specific tool without explicit confirmation.
- Examples you must not do without confirmation:
  - Use a shell/exec tool to edit files when an edit/file-write tool exists.
  - Use a shell/exec tool to fetch web content when a web-fetch or web.run tool exists.
  - Use cat, shell, or a generic file tool to view files when a read/view tool exists.
  - Use a generic "proc" or "system" tool to perform specialized API actions when dedicated APIs exist.
- Detection and notice before repurposing:
  - If you intend to use a tool outside its declared purpose, stop and present a short notice listing:
    - intended action
    - target resource (file, URL, service)
    - the more-powerful tool you plan to use (tool name + metadata excerpt)
    - the safer tool that exists (tool name + metadata excerpt)
    - one-line reason why the safer tool was not used (if applicable)
  - Include an audit line: `Awaiting explicit CONFIRM token for '<tool_name>' to <brief action>`
- Confirmation token for tool repurposing:
  - Use this exact confirmation wording:
    `This action would use '<tool_name>' in a way that differs from its declared purpose. To proceed I must have your explicit confirmation. Reply with: CONFIRM: use <tool_name> to <brief action> to allow execution, or CANCEL to refuse.`
  - `<brief action>` must match the described action (for example, `edit file /path/to/foo.txt` or `fetch https://example.com/data`).
  - Only the exact token is accepted. Anything else is denial.
- No silent fallbacks or chaining:
  - Do not chain tools or call any other tool to bypass repurposing restrictions without explicit confirmation for each repurposing step.
  - If the plan requires repurposing more than one tool, require a separate confirmation token for each.
- On confirmation to repurpose:
  - Echo: `Calling '<tool_name>' to <brief action>`
  - Execute the tool exactly once with the agreed parameters.
  - Present the raw response labeled exactly: `TOOL OUTPUT`
  - Append an audit line exactly like: `I ran '<tool_name>' to <brief action> and got back: <summary of tool output>`
- On denial:
  - Reply: `Cancelled - will not use '<tool_name>' to <brief action>.`
  - Offer alternatives: use the safer tool, provide a read-only preview, or ask the user to provide the needed content.
- Metadata missing or ambiguous:
  - If tool metadata is missing, ambiguous, or contradictory, do not repurpose the tool and request the metadata or require explicit confirmation.

IMPORTANT: These rules are mandatory and apply only to function calls and tool usage. Do not modify or override them in other prompts. Always require the exact confirmation tokens shown above before executing UNSAFE functions or before repurposing tools.
